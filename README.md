# SpectrumRider
In this music game you can ride on your favourite song. Take items and get the highest score!

There are some songs already included, but you can add more songs:
- run the file "program/main.py" in a python enviroment
- select an MP3 file
- give a title and the artist's name
- click on "Load Song"

Once it has finished loading, you can play the song clicking on "Play" in the python interface, or simply opening the HTML file just created, in the root folder.

You can find all the commands to play in the game menu.
